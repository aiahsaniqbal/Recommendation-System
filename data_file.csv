73,White Teeth - (PB),Zadie Smith,"Published in the first month of the first year of the new century, Zadie Smith's debut novel &quot;White Teeth&quot; - winner of the Guardian First Book Award and the Whitbread First Novel Award - was an immediate bestseller and stunningly acclaimed. One of the most talked about fictional debuts of ever, &quot;White Teeth&quot; is a funny, generous, big-hearted novel, adored by critics and readers alike. Dealing - among many other things - with friendship, love, war, three cultures and three families over three generations, one brown mouse, and the tricky way the past has of coming back and biting you on the ankle, it is a life-affirming, riotous must-read of a book. &quot;Funny, clever ...and a rollicking good read&quot;. (&quot;Independent&quot;). &quot;An astonishingly assured debut, funny and serious...I was delighted&quot;. (Salman Rushdie). &quot;The almost preposterous talent was clear from the first pages&quot;.",Fiction &amp; Literature,9.78014E+12,Penguin Books
